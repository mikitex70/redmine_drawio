# Changelog

## v0.7.2-develop (unreleased)

### New

* Tested on Redmine 3.4.0-stable. [Michele Tessaro]

  Russian for drawio_jstoolbar

* Added mathemathics support in SVG (refs #17) [Michele Tessaro]

  Added support for mathematical symbols in SVG diagrams.
  The support must be enabled in the plugin configuration as it adds about
  170k of Javascript.

* Added Simplified Chinese translation file. [Steven.W@UTH]

### Fix

* Fixed foreign characters in SVG diagrams (refs #36) [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed invalid character stripping from filenames (refs #35) [Michele Tessaro]

  The filenames must be stripped from some characters that can cause
  troubles in the filesystem or in the web page.
  The old algorithm was too strict and was removing international
  characters too.

* Fixed typo in drawio_jstoolbar-en.js. [Denis Sidorov]

* Fixed saving on DMSF 1.5.9+ (fixes #32) [Michele Tessaro]

  Fixed saving on DMSF 1.5.9+ when &quot;Use project name for project folder&quot;
  is selected in the plugin settings.
  Note that the version tagged 1.5.9 has a bug in the webdav path URI: at
  this time the master branch must be used.


## v0.7.1 (2017-06-12)

### Changes

* Updated changelog. [Michele Tessaro]

* Disabled SSL if drawio service has HTTP protocol. [Michele Tessaro]

  Disabling SSL can help use on using local drawio installations.
  Now you can use a local installation without the need to create a
  certificate.
  Do not use HTTP protocol if your drawio is exposed to Internet.

* Added a note to the documentation. [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fixed a check on diagram filename extension. [Michele Tessaro]


## v0.7.0 (2017-06-11)

### New

* Skipped authentication on attachment update (fixes #23) [Michele Tessaro]

  The drawio_attach macro can upload a new version of diagram without
  asking for authentication.
  This can authentication problems with plugin provided providers.
  The drawio_dmsf works as previous: no way to bypass secondary login.

* Decoded HTTP error 422 (closes #22) [Michele Tessaro]

  When saving diagrams as attachments, if the attachment is too big
  Redmine return an HTTP 422 error (Enprocessable Entity).
  Now a more clear message would be reporte.

* Added support for internationalization. [Michele Tessaro]

* Editing support for textile button macros. [Michele Tessaro]

  Placing che cursor in a body macro e clicking the macro button will open
  the dialog pre-filled with the values extracted from the macro heading.
  This can be useful to change values with a pre-validating dialog instead
  of changing he macro directly, with the risk of syntax errors or wrong
  parameter names.

* CKEditor support (refs #21) [Michele Tessaro]

  If the Redmine CKEditor plugin is in use, one button (or two, if the
  DMSF plugin is installed) will be added to the toolbar.
  Handling of diagrams inside of the editor is not easy because the
  document body must be saved before the diagrams, so at this time the
  dialogs are only shortcuts for inserting macros.
  Maybe I can add embedded editing for already created diagrams.

* Disabled dmsf editor button if no redmine_dmsf plugin. [Michele Tessaro]

  The editor button for inserting the drawio_dmsf macro now will be draw
  only if the redmine_dmsf plugin is active.

* Added EasyRedmine detection. [Michele Tessaro]

* Refactor to let work with easyredmine. [Michele Tessaro]

* Disabled dmsf editor button if no redmine_dmsf plugin. [Michele Tessaro]

  The editor button for inserting the drawio_dmsf macro now will be draw
  only if the redmine_dmsf plugin is active.

* Added EasyRedmine detection. [Michele Tessaro]

* Refactor to let work with easyredmine (fixes #13, #18, #19) [Michele Tessaro]

* Ignored case when checking if SVG diagram requested. [Michele Tessaro]

  Now the drawio_attach and drawio_dmsf macros will check the document
  extension in a case-insensitive manner; extensions like svg, SVG, Svg
  are all interpreted as a request to use an SVG diagram format.

* Added embedded editor support for SVG images (closes #17) [Michele Tessaro]

### Changes

* Udated changelog. [Michele Tessaro]

* Skipped issue note creation in EasyRedmine (refs #28) [Michele Tessaro]

  EasyRedmine can update attachments so there is no need to add a new
  issue note (a journal) when a diagram is updated.

* Updated documentation. [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fixed updating diagrams on private notes (fixes #28) [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed saving of SVGs (fixes #26, #26) [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed SVG corrupted after save before reload (fixes #25) [Michele Tessaro]

  After editing an SVG diagram and saving it, double clicking on the
  diagram without reloading page causes an `Not a diagram` error in the
  drawio diagram editor.
  Seems that updating the SVG in the page causes the insertion of an
  `&quot;=&quot;&quot;&#x27; text, that confuses the parser.
  Removed with an regex, but not identified the source problem (maybe
  related to the `XMLSerializer` Firefox browser object).

* Fixed macros after refactor for easyredmine (refs #18) [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fixed UTF-8 encoding in init.rb (fixes #14) [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed computation of Redmine URL (fixes #11) [Michele Tessaro]

  drawio_attach macro, that caused &quot;Not found&quot; errors.


## v0.4.0 (2016-12-10)

### New

* Added option to set diagram size (refs #8) [Michele Tessaro]
