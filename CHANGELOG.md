# Changelog

## 1.4.9-xmr (2024-03-25)

### Changes

* Default Mathjax version to 3.2.2
* plugin settings handling

## v1.4.8 (2023-10-22)

### New

* Added support for `drawio` diagram extension (#131) [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fixes wrong number of arguments exception. [Liane Hampe]

  The macro drawio_dmsf will raise an exception when a user applies
  the macro to a previously uploaded drawio file (file ending does not
  matter).

  The error occurs in DmsfFileRevision#disk_file which has changed four
  month ago.

* Fixes uncaught type error. [Liane Hampe]

  Math support will only be provided if the user has checked the
  corresponding box in plugin settings. When no math support is required
  the javascript snippet should be ignored.

  Since only MathJax will be ignored and not MathJax.Hub, javascript will
  raise a type error. This is fixed with a further condition.

### Other

* Adds some unit tests. [Liane Hampe]

  Will add some unit tests for drawio macros.

* Extends error message. [Liane Hampe]

  The extension drawio is missing in an error message listing supported
  diagram formats.

* Changes spelling in heredoc string. [Liane Hampe]

  Will remove inverted comma (') from heredoc string since there are
  interpreted as the beginning of a normal string
  ('text between inverted comma') which won't be closed.

  The results is an unreadable code in some IDE such that vscode.

* Changes spelling in heredoc string. [Liane Hampe]

  Will remove inverted comma (') from heredoc string since there are
  interpreted as the beginning of a normal string
  ('text between inverted comma') which won't be closed.

  The results is an unreadable code in some IDE such that vscode.


## v1.4.7 (2023-06-24)

### Fix

* Fixed drawing math symbols with XML diagrams. [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed passing parameters in drawio url (fixes #128) [Michele Tessaro]


## v1.4.6 (2023-01-28)

### Fix

* Fixes some tests. [Liane Hampe]

  Since Ruby 3 passing method argumentes changed. A Hash won't be
  converted to a keyword argument anymore. Therefore, keyword argumentes
  needs to be entered explicitly by default. To keep the behaviour double
  splat needs to be added to hash arguments.

  See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/

* Fixes common mark support. [Liane Hampe]

  The helper for supporting common mark was prepared but not loaded.
  Therefore, the wikitool bar does not extend with the required
  drawio buttons.

  By requiring the helper file in lib/redmine_drawio.rb the code will
  be executed now.

  Fixed also some trouble in inserting macro code after editing.

* Fixed patching of viewer-static.min.js (refs #120) [Michele Tessaro]

  The code in `viewer-static.min.js` from `embed.diagrams.net` was

  Fixed the patch of the viewer of diagrams in XML format, caused by a
  recent change in the Drawio scripts.

### Other

* Fixed check for api enabled. [Liane Hampe]

  ViewLayoutsBaseHtmlHeadHook#hash_code uses a wrong api enabled check which
  would not return true if rest api is enabled.

* Fixed generating api key even if api not enabeld. [Liane Hampe]

  When the api is not enabled there should be no api key requested
  for the current user. Moreover, Redmine
  MyControllerTest#test_reset_api_key_without_existing_key
  would fail since it does not expect the current user to have an api key by
  default.

  Added a warning for the admin if api is disabled since the plugin needs
  the api for saving diagrams as attachment.

  Adds tests for this fix and a check for the settings table.
  The table check is necessary for running tests since the table is not
  available when loading the code.

  asking for authentication.
  This can authentication problems with plugin provided providers.
  The drawio_dmsf works as previous: no way to bypass secondary login.

* Decoded HTTP error 422 (closes #22) [Michele Tessaro]

  When saving diagrams as attachments, if the attachment is too big
  Redmine return an HTTP 422 error (Enprocessable Entity).
  Now a more clear message would be reporte.

* Added support for internationalization. [Michele Tessaro]

* Editing support for textile button macros. [Michele Tessaro]

  Placing che cursor in a body macro e clicking the macro button will open
  the dialog pre-filled with the values extracted from the macro heading.
  This can be useful to change values with a pre-validating dialog instead
  of changing he macro directly, with the risk of syntax errors or wrong
  parameter names.

* CKEditor support (refs #21) [Michele Tessaro]

  If the Redmine CKEditor plugin is in use, one button (or two, if the
  DMSF plugin is installed) will be added to the toolbar.
  Handling of diagrams inside of the editor is not easy because the
  document body must be saved before the diagrams, so at this time the
  dialogs are only shortcuts for inserting macros.
  Maybe I can add embedded editing for already created diagrams.

* Disabled dmsf editor button if no redmine_dmsf plugin. [Michele Tessaro]

  The editor button for inserting the drawio_dmsf macro now will be draw
  only if the redmine_dmsf plugin is active.

* Added EasyRedmine detection. [Michele Tessaro]

* Refactor to let work with easyredmine. [Michele Tessaro]

* Disabled dmsf editor button if no redmine_dmsf plugin. [Michele Tessaro]

* Refactor to let work with easyredmine (fixes #13, #18, #19) [Michele Tessaro]

* Ignored case when checking if SVG diagram requested. [Michele Tessaro]

  Now the drawio_attach and drawio_dmsf macros will check the document
  extension in a case-insensitive manner; extensions like svg, SVG, Svg
  are all interpreted as a request to use an SVG diagram format.

* Added embedded editor support for SVG images (closes #17) [Michele Tessaro]

### Changes

* Udated changelog. [Michele Tessaro]

* Skipped issue note creation in EasyRedmine (refs #28) [Michele Tessaro]

  EasyRedmine can update attachments so there is no need to add a new
  issue note (a journal) when a diagram is updated.

* Updated documentation. [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fix #27: Javascript error match on undefined. [Alexander Menk]

  Prevented saving in EasyRedmine issue note

  Prevented saving in EasyRedmine issue note

* Fixed updating diagrams on private notes (fixes #28) [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed saving of SVGs (fixes #26, #26) [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed SVG corrupted after save before reload (fixes #25) [Michele Tessaro]

  After editing an SVG diagram and saving it, double clicking on the
  diagram without reloading page causes an `Not a diagram` error in the
  drawio diagram editor.
  Seems that updating the SVG in the page causes the insertion of an
  `"=""' text, that confuses the parser.
  Removed with an regex, but not identified the source problem (maybe
  related to the `XMLSerializer` Firefox browser object).

* Fixed macros after refactor for easyredmine (refs #18) [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed macros after refactor for easyredmine (refs #18) [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fixed computation of Redmine URL (fixes #11) [Michele Tessaro]

  Fixed a missing slash in the url while uploading attachments throught
  drawio_attach macro, that caused "Not found" errors.


## v0.4.0 (2016-12-10)

### New

* Added option to set diagram size (refs #8) [Michele Tessaro]

  Added option ``size`` to macros ``drawio_attach`` and ``drawio_dmsf`` to
  allow resize diagram image.
  The size option sets the image width, in pixels; default is original
  image width.

### Changes

* Fixed errors when used outside wiki pages (refs #9) [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed redmine path with custom route (fixes #7) [Michele Tessaro]

  Fixed calculation of Redmine web path when using custom routes, such

  http://www.redmine.org/boards/2/topics/32811)

* Load 'loading' image using protocol-relative paths. [Javango]

  When loading the ajax-loader image from a https site I am getting the following error message,  this switches to protocol-relative paths.
